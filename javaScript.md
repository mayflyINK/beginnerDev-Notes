# Javascript Concepts
- syntax parsers and compilers are programs that read the instructions given in the code (browsers)
- lexical environment, where you write something eg. a variable "sits" inside a function
- execution context, wrappers that manage written code
- name-value pairs, a name mapped to a value (address = 1 street)
- object is a collection of name-value pairs

Javascript Engine
- global execution context (accessible everywhere to everything in code)
  - creates a "global object"
  - creates a variable "this"
